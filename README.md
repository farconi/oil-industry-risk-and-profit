| Risk and Profit Assessment in the Oil Industry | This project involved analyzing three oil extraction regions, with a focus on Region 1, using linear regression models to predict the volume of reserves in oil wells. Average profits, confidence intervals, and risks of loss were calculated for each region, leading to an investment recommendation in that region. The project provided valuable insights for decision-making in the oil industry. | *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *numpy*, *sklearn* |
